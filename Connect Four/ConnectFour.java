 * Connect Four Game Implementation
 * <p>
 * This program simulates the classic two-player Connect Four game where players
 * take turns dropping colored discs into a 2D grid. The game
 * continues until one of the players forms a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal
 * line of four of their own discs or until the board is completely filled without
 * any player winning, resulting in a draw. </p>
 * <p>
 * The game board is a 2D grid consisting of six rows and seven columns. The red
 * disc is represented by 'R', the yellow disc by 'Y'</p>
 * <p>
 * In each turn, the program:
 * - Prompts the current player (alternating between red and yellow) to choose a
 *   column to drop their disc into.
 * - Validates the player's input and ensures the chosen column has space.
 * - Adds the disc to the lowest empty space in the chosen column.
 * - Redraws the game board in the console showing the current state.
 * - Checks the status of the game for a win, draw, or continuation. </p>
 * <p>
 * If a player successfully lines up four discs of their color in a row, column,
 * or diagonal, the program announces them as the winner. If all spaces are filled
 * and no player has achieved this, the program declares a draw. The program can
 * then be restarted to play a new game if the players decide to continue. </p>
