# Investment Value Calculator

## Project Overview

This Java program is designed to calculate the total value of an investment and the interest earned over a period, factoring in the initial amount invested (principal), the annual percentage rate (APR), compounding periods per year, regular additional deposits, and the total investment duration. It provides a valuable tool for investors looking to understand the future value of their investments, especially in instruments like treasury bills where interest is compounded at regular intervals.

## Features

- **Customizable Investment Parameters:** Allows users to input the principal amount, yearly interest rate (APR), compounding frequency, additional deposit amounts, and the investment duration.
- **Compound Interest Calculation:** Computes the total value of an investment considering the compound interest effect.
- **Interest Earned Calculation:** Calculates the total interest earned over the investment period, accounting for additional deposits.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Prompts the user for input and displays neatly formatted output, making it easy to understand the investment's performance.

## Usage

The program prompts the user for the following inputs:

-Initial amount to invest (principal).
-Yearly interest rate (rate).
-Number of times the interest is compounded each year (periodsPerYear).
-Amount added to the investment in each period after the initial one (deposit).
-Total number of periods the investment will accrue over (totalPeriods).
-After collecting the inputs, the program calculates and displays the total value of the investment and the total interest earned over the specified period.
